                    <p>When a believer dies, it becomes incumbent on family members to ensure that the wealth and property left behind are distributed according to Shariah Law prescribed in the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah.</p>

                    <p>After meeting the initial expenses incurred in giving the deceased an Islamic burial, and after paying all debts and <em>mahr</em> (dowry) that may still be due to the wife, <strong>up to one-third of the remaining estate may be expended according to the deceased’s legal will</strong>, but only for those who <strong>are NOT entitled heirs</strong> under Shariah.</p>

                    <p><strong>Zakat payments</strong>, if any are due by the deceased, must be paid <strong>before</strong> the settlement of debts and <strong>before</strong> burial expenses are taken from the deceased’s property.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>remainder</strong> must be distributed to all legal heirs as defined by the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah.</p>
