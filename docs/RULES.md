# **Inheritance According to Islamic Sharia Law**

When a believer dies, it becomes incumbent on family members to ensure that the wealth and property left behind are distributed according to Shariah Law prescribed in the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah.

After meeting the initial expenses incurred in giving the deceased an Islamic burial, and after paying all debts and *mahr* (dowry) that may still be due to the wife, **up to one-third of the remaining estate may be expended according to the deceased’s legal will**, but only for those who **are NOT entitled heirs** under Shariah.

**Zakat payments**, if any are due by the deceased, must be paid **before** the settlement of debts and **before** burial expenses are taken from the deceased’s property.

The **remainder** must be distributed to all legal heirs as defined by the Qur’an and authentic Sunnah.

# **Inheritance Logic**

## **1. Share of Husband**

* **No descendants (children/grandchildren):**
  Husband = **1/2**
* **Descendants exist:**
  Husband = **1/4**

---

## **2. Share of Wife**

* **No descendants:**
  Wife = **1/4**
* **Descendants exist:**
  Wife = **1/8**

---

## **3. Share of Daughter(s)**

* **One daughter (no sons):**
  Daughter = **1/2**
* **Two or more daughters (no sons):**
  Daughters = **2/3** (shared equally)
* **If sons exist:**
  Sons : Daughters = **2 : 1**

---

## **4. Share of Father**

* **Descendants exist:**
  Father = **1/6**
* **No male descendants:**
  Father = **1/6 + residue**
* **No descendants at all:**
  Father = **residue**

---

## **5. Share of Mother**

* **Descendants or siblings exist:**
  Mother = **1/6**
* **No descendants:**

  * No siblings, father, or spouse → Mother = **1/3**
  * If siblings/father/spouse exist → Mother = **1/3 of residue**

---

## **6. Uterine Siblings (same mother, different father)**

* **One uterine sibling:**
  If no descendants and no male ascendants → Share = **1/6**
* **Two or more uterine siblings:**
  If same conditions → Share = **1/3** (shared equally)

---

## **7. Share of Son’s Daughter**

* **One son’s daughter:**

  * No daughters, no son’s son → **1/2**
  * If son’s son exists → she receives *half the share of a son’s son* (2:1 ratio)

* **Two or more son’s daughters:**

  * No daughters, no son’s son → **2/3** (shared equally)
  * If son’s son exists → ratio **2:1**

---

## **8. Full Brother/Sister**

(From same father and mother)

Inherit **only** when there are **no descendants** and **no ascendants**.

* **If deceased is male and one full sister exists (no female descendants):**
  Sister = **1/2**

* **If deceased is female and one full brother exists (no female descendants):**
  Brother takes all (as residuary)

* **Two or more siblings (brothers or sisters):**
  Sisters = **2/3**
  Brothers & sisters together = **2:1**

* **If female descendant exists:**
  One full sister = **1/6**
  One full brother = **1/6**
  Multiple → **1/3 shared**

---

## **9. Consanguine Sister**

(Same father, different mother)

Only inherits when:

* No sons, no sons’ sons
* No father
* No full brothers

Shares:

* Alone → **1/2**
* Two or more → **2/3**
* If full sister exists + consanguine brother(s) → ratio **2:1**

---

## **10. True Grandmother**

Condition: Line not interrupted by a male between two females.
Only inherits if parents are not alive.

Examples:

* Mother’s mother
* Father’s mother
* Father’s father’s mother

Share: **1/6**

---

## **11. True Grandfather**

Condition: Line not interrupted by a female between two males.
Only inherits if parents are not alive.

Examples:

* Father’s father
* Father’s father’s father
* Mother’s father

Shares:

* With male descendants → **1/6**
* With female descendants only → **1/6 + residue**
* No descendants → **residue**

---

## **12. Uncles & Aunts**

Inherit **only in absence of grandparents**
They do **not** inherit if descendants exist.

Ratio: **Male : Female = 2 : 1**

---

## **13. Nephews & Nieces**

Inherit **only in absence of siblings**.
They take the share their parent would have taken.

Ratio: **2 : 1**

---

## **14. If No Relatives Exist**

All inheritance goes to **Bayt-ul-Maal (Islamic trust / public treasury).**
